  <h1>Writing Is a Passion, too!</h1>
  <p>I have been writing for many years.  I am an award-winning writer, and I taught language and reading for a profession.  I currently write and edit for publications, my personal inspirational blogs, as well as for individual projects commissioned by patrons and clients. </p>
